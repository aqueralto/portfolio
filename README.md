### [Predicting the Survival of Passangers from the Titanic]([https://www.kaggle.com/code/albertqueralto/surviving-titanic-with-ml])
- Performed feature engineering, preprocessing and exploratory data analysis on the Titanic dataset.
- Developed 5 machine learning models to compare their outputs. The best ones (Random Forest Classifier and XGBoost Classifier were selected for hyperparameter tuning. <b>Best score = 0.76315</b>.

- Used a REST API and web scraping tools to collect data related to SpaceX launches.
- Created interactive maps, graphs, and a [Plotly dashboard](http://spacexdashappkellibelcher.pythonanywhere.com/) to explore the data and identify important features.
- Built a Support Vector Machine model to predict the likelihood of a rocket launch success with an [Area Under the Curve of 0.958](https://www.kaggle.com/kellibelcher/spacex-rocket-landing-predictive-analysis).
